            Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Karolina and I am a full stack web developer
            living in Middle Sackville, Nova Scotia. My passion for technology
            has pushed me to pivot from being a corporate coach and explore the
            depths of software development. I have graduated from LightHouse
            Labs Software Development Programe with the following stack
            expertise:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Languages:</b> JavaScript, HTML+CSS, Ruby
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Databases and CMS:</b> SQL, PostgreSQL, Relational Databases,
              WordPress
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Frameworks, libraries and enviroments:</b> React, Node.js,
              AJAX, jQuery, Express, SASS, EJS, JSX, Sinatra
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Testing:</b> Mocha, Chai, Cypress, JEST, StoryBook
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tracking and collaboration:</b> JIRA, Confluence, GitHub, Git
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I love software development for its fast-pace and innovative nature.
            It allows me to work on problems independently as well as leverage
            the power of brain strorming when solving problems collobarotively.
            I have been recognized by my work collegues for strong work ethics
            and comminication skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            When not coding you can find me hiking with my family, at the gym or
            reading Medium.
